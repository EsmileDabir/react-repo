This is a modern React + Vite landing page designed for a premium sports shoe brand, showcasing a sleek UI with bold typography and a clean layout. The front page features sections like Menu, Location, About, and Contact, along with call-to-action buttons and external purchase links. While it's not yet fully responsive, it provides a strong foundation for further development. The project is deployed with Vercel for easy access and sharing.
